# QuantFund

git clone https://github.com/Polymarket/py-clob-client.git

cd py-clob-client

git fetch origin pull/114/head:<branch-name:whatever the name you wish>

git checkout branch_name

pip install .

After that, we need to get the code into the machine from git and then run the file

git clone https://github.com/cd1524/QuantFund.git

cd examples

pythonÂ polymarket_data.py

You will need to change the key in the code to your polymarket account. We can share a key address but will discuss in person.

Running this file will allow you to change keywords and return the top polymarkets with that word. E.g. 'elon' or 'ethereum'. Doing so will then pull the required data from that market.
